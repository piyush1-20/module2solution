           <p>An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).</p>

           <p>A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

               <h2>Stacks</h2>
<p>Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).</p>

<p>A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). </p>

<p>A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.</p>
